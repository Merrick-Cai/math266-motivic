These notes are on *unstable motivic homotopy theory*, taught at Harvard in Fall of 2024. During the semester I'm updating them twice a week with new lectures, and I encourage everyone (students of the class, friends, colleagues, strangers) to suggest changes! You can do this by [submitting a pull request](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request&ved=2ahUKEwi7sLq05LOIAxW3tIkEHf2eEDoQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0OafNHvMFfUq56q9rPOrPT) or by emailing me at brazelton@math.harvard.edu.

## What do I get by submitting a pull request and suggesting a change?

Aside from eternal glory and my undying gratitude, I will owe you a coffee or beer at the next conference we attend together, and I will _**add your name to the acknowledgements**_

## What sort of change is worth suggesting?

Anything from completely rewriting a proof I have, adding a new example you found, or just fixing a typo or adding a missing period! No suggestion is too small. This is [how the Stacks Project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/contribute) [operates](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/contributors) ðŸ˜ƒ

## What if I don't have a suggested change, but I have a question about something that's confusing in the notes?

You'll see that [Issues tab](https://github.com/tbrazel/math266-motivic/issues) at the top of the page. Just open a new issue and describe your question, and I'll try to change the notes to address it!
