Let $t \le \tau$ be two covers, we say that $\tau$ \textit{refines} $t$, or that $t$ is \textit{coarser} than $\tau$. What this means is that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Every $t$-cover is a $\tau$-cover
    \item Every $\tau$-sheaf is a $t$-sheaf
    \item If $\mathscr{F}$ is a $t$-torsor then it is a $\tau$-torsor if it is a $\tau$-sheaf
    \item If $\mathscr{F}$ is a $\tau$-torsor it is a $t$-torsor if and only if it is $t$-locally trivial.
\end{enumerate}
